|Week 1 | Created the repo and the ReadME. Also did some research.| Making floor cells spawn. | Attempting to make walls spawn. | Day off due to 2nd christmas day. | Crunched to try and finish everything with negative results. | More research about mazes. Practically started over from this point. | I started working on the maze algorithm, and it worked. |
|Week 2 | Worked on the camera and the UI elements. Finishing up and handing in. | | | | | | |
